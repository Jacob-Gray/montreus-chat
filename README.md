# montreus-chat
Montreus Chatting Solution, as you can find on http://painless.montreus.com:3030
It works with Node.js, and supports Markdown. It includes tons of security: Protection against XSS scripting, against huge messages and thousands of robot connections that could take the server down.
For installing it, you must first make sure Node.js is installed, then create a directory for it and run:
<br>
  `npm install`
<br>
  `node app.js` OR `forever start app.js`
