Montreus Chatting Solution, as you can find on http://painless.montreus.com:3030
It works with Node.js, and supports Markdown. Pretty simple. And yes, it has just 2 files.
For installing it, you must first make sure Node.js is installed, then create a directory for it and run:
<br>
  `npm install express --save`
<br>
  `npm install socket.io --save`
<br>
  `npm install markdown-it --save`
<br>
  `npm install moment --save`

  After that, simply do `node app.js`
Note: The `client` and `server` folders are separate for organization. For a production environment, you should use them on the same folder.
